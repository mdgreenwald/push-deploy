# Push-Deploy #

Push-Deploy is a Python application which helps to securely and simply enable communication between external tools (GitHub Actions, Circle CI, etcâ€¦) and Kubernetes without exposing cluster credentials.

In particular for projects which may not have `semver` inplace where other tools like keel.sh and weave/flux would make more sense.
