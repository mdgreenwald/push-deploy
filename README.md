# Push-Deploy #

Push-Deploy is a Python application which helps to securely and simply enable communication between external tools (GitHub Actions, Circle CI, etcâ€¦) and Kubernetes without exposing credentials.

In particular for projects which may not have semver inplace where other tools like keel and weave/flux make more sense.
