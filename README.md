# Push-Deploy

Push-Deploy is a Python application which helps to securely and simply enable communication between external tools (GitHub Actions, Circle CI, etcâ€¦) and Kubernetes without exposing cluster credentials. Instead it exposes an API which accepts parameters.

Push-deploy is focused on projects which may not have `semver` in place where other tools like [keel.sh](https://keel.sh/) and [weave/flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) would make more sense.

## Disclaimer

This is pre-release software and is very limited. It will have bugs and lacks many features planned for later releases. The API may also change in ways which are not backwards compatible.

## Configuration

* `PD_REGISTRY`: Registry URI e.g. `258640715359.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
* `PD_SECRET_KEY`: A very long (64+ Char) Alpha Numeric string
* `PD_USER`: Username to authenticate with
* `PD_PASSWORD`: Password to authenticate with

## Usage

```bash
TOKEN=$(
    curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --request POST \
    -d '{"username":"${USERNAME}","password":"${PASSWORD}"}' \
    https://pushdeploy.domain.com/api/v1/auth
    )
```

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
--request POST \
"https://pushdeploy.domain.com/api/v1/deployment?name=${NAME}&namespace=${NAMESPACE}&image_name=${IMAGE_NAME}&image_tag=${IMAGE_TAG}"
```

#### Dependencies

**Note:** push-deploy uses `config.load_incluster_config()`and depends on the kubernetes api and thus cannot be meaningfuly run outside of a cluster.

- Local Docker Daemon

- Kubernetes Cluster (Remote or local e.g. Docker for Mac Kubernetes, Microk8s, Minikube, etc...)

- [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/)

#### Resources

- [kubernetes-client/python](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python)

- [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

- [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)

#### Usage

From root:

```bash
$ tilt up
```

Tilt will now continuously monitor for changes and rebuild and re-apply.
