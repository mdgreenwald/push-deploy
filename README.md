# Push-Deploy #

Push-Deploy is a Python application which helps to securely and simply enable communication between external tools (GitHub Actions, Circle CI, etcâ€¦) and Kubernetes without exposing cluster credentials.

In particular for projects which may not have `semver` inplace where other tools like [keel.sh](https://keel.sh/) and [weave/flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) would make more sense.

### Disclaimer ###

This is pre-release software and is very limited. It will have bugs and lacks many features planned for later releases. The API may also change in ways which are not backwards compatible.

* `PD_NAMESPACE`: Namespace of the deployment
* `PD_DEPLOYMENT`: Name of the deployment
* `PD_REGISTRY`: Registry URI e.g. `258640715359.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
* `PD_SECRET_KEY`: A very long (64+ Char) Alpha Numeric string
* `PD_USER`: Username to authenticate with
* `PD_PASSWORD`: Password to authenticate with
